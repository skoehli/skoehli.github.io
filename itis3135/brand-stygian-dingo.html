        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                We strive to make dark mode available for everyone. With dark mode becoming more popular, its health benefits are no secret. With less strain on the eyes
                and an easier time getting to sleep, it's hard to say no to dark mode! We want it to be easier for people to access their favorite sites while simultaneously
                providing similar themes as design solutions to up-and-coming sites. Everyone has the right to a slender, calming theme!

                Some awesome stuff about us:
