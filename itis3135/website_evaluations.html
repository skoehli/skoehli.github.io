            <h3>Terrible Design: <a href="https://arngren.net" target="_blank">arngren.net</a></h3>
            <p>
                This website is written in Norweigan. At a glance, it seems as if this website is a showcase for various vehicles, toys, and other paraphernalia. 
                Upon closer examination, however, this website lists these various products for sale. Occasionally, the specifications for products are listed, but otherwise,
                they do not have descriptions. Upon clicking a link to a certain item, another page is reached where more products are listed. This page appears to give a more 
                detailed text description of the products listed. When customers wish to order a product, however, they are not greeted with a page that allows them to easily
                enter debit/credit card credentials. Rather, they reach a page that gives additional instructions on how to pay via check, 
                including directions to add shipping manually to their order costs. There is a search bar in the homepage, but good luck finding it.

                <strong>Analysis using CRAP principles:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> For the most part, this website has decent contrast. With light background colors and dark text, it is difficult to
                                                   have poor contrast. However, there is text overlayed on top of photos and pictures that is difficult to read 
                                                   because of its contrast with the photo/picture it is in.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The only aspects of design that are consistent in the design of this website is the general white background
                                                     and the font that is used. Text does not seem to follow a particular size or color format. Instead, its colors
                                                     and sizes change randomly, so it is difficult to tell what that text is meant to represent. There are many 
                                                     occurrences where there is blue underlined text that looks identical to a link, but is actually not clickable.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Nothing in this website follows any axis. In the homepage, there are no rows, nor are there any columns. Instead, there are 
                                                    boxes littered randomly throughout the page. After clicking a link to a product, there is some effort made 
                                                    to organize the page through the use of columns, however they
                                                    either end rather abruptly or spiral down further into the page and overlap into another column.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements on this website have no sense of direction or boundaries. Some overlap over others, while others are obscured by their neighbors.
                                                    On the homepage specifically, there are boxes that contain a product listing, along with another box that contains another product that
                                                    is unrelated to the larger box it is sitting in. Because elements on the homepage are so close together, there is a painful amount
                                                    of white space on the right side of the page.

            <h3>Acceptable Design: <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.com" target="_blank">oldschool.runescape.com</a></h3>
            <p>
                This website is designed for a popular, UK-based MMORPG called Old School RuneScape. Created in the same era as arngren.net, it has a simplistic design and is
                easy to follow. This website is a platform for the RuneScape community to access the game itself, recent news, updates, forums, and much more. 
                Signing up for an account is quick, and it includes a link to download a desktop client of the game. The homepage has important links near the top
                of the page. Every page in the website has a footer that clearly states copyright and provides links to the websites privacy policy, 
                terms and conditions, and cookie settings.
            </p>

                <strong>Analysis using CRAP principles:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> While the website uses a color scheme that has dangerously similar colors, there is an effort made to place light text 
                                                   on top of dark backgrounds, and dark text on light backgrounds. Text is emphasized to indicate section titles; the text in
                                                   these sections is less emphasized but still readable. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> This website follows a very consistent theme. While text color changes based on the background it is placed on, the size follows a
                                                     distinct format. Every section title has the same color and size, while the body text also has the same color and size. Almost every 
                                                     page in the website has the same color scheme (if not incredibly similar). The only text element in the homepage that is fundamentally
                                                     different from every other text element is the text "Welcome to Old School RuneScape!," which appears to be a different font than
                                                     any other text on the page.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Similar objects that are meant to be grouped together are aligned on a distinct axis. Important links contained in objects are listed in line with
                                                    each other. News posts are centered in a column and are lined up with each other. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> There are minor proximity issues on the homepage, particularly near the top of the page. The first box containing links to other pages encroaches on
                                                    the text below the header graphic that states how many players are online. The title text of these boxes are also too close to the first link
                                                    in these lists. Because of how these boxes are shaped and placed, there is an awkward space above the section that contains news posts. Aside from that, the content 
                                                    on this page fits slugly together, but not too close that it is hard to read and access.
                    </li>
                </ul>
