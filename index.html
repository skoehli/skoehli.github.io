        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            At the time of writing this, I am going for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity. At the time of
            writing this, I am considering entering the early graduate school program to get a Masters in Cybersecurity. 
            Currently, I am set to graduate Spring 2023.

            A little bit about my professional background:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the year 2014, I volunteered 100 hours in an after-school tutoring program, where I assisted a teacher in providing
                    activities that were meant to help third grade students improve their reading comprehension skills. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since 2016, I have been working at a local store in customer service and developing soft skills.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Current professional goals:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Finish Nathan House's complete course on Cybersecurity on Udemy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Study Wireshark; understand what it may be used for and how to filter the results it gives to find desirable information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Refresh my skills in Java in order to prepare for a TA position in Spring 2022.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            A bit about my personal interests:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I play video games a fair bit. I mostly play different types of RPGs, such as MMOs, action RPGs, and some turn-based RPGs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I love the outdoors. Recently, I have taken up hiking. Currently I am slowly working my way through going to all the different
                    trails and attractions in the Blue Ridge Parkway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If I were to be an advocate for a cause, it would be for adult children who are estranged from toxic parents. This is actually
                    not a rare phenomenon, yet it is stigmatized. Being an estranged child myself, I wish that I could give back to children in
                    need some day.
                </li>
            </ul>
